## ⚖️ Iron Laws

**These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. No exceptions. No shortcuts.**

### 1. TDD Iron Law
> **NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST**

- Write test → Run (FAIL) → Write code → Run (PASS)
- Code written before test? **DELETE IT. Start over.**

### 2. Debugging Iron Law
> **NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST**

- Investigate → Understand → Fix
- 3+ failed fixes = wrong architecture. STOP and reassess.

### 3. Verification Iron Law
> **NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE**

- Run the command → Read the output → THEN make the claim
- Never say "should work" or "I'm confident" without evidence

## 🔀 Deviation Rules

When you discover something unexpected during execution:

| Rule | Trigger | Action |
|:----:|---------|--------|
| **1** | Bug discovered | 🔧 Auto-fix immediately |
| **2** | Missing critical (deps, config) | ➕ Auto-add immediately |
| **3** | Blocker (prevents progress) | 🚧 Auto-fix immediately |
| **4** | Architectural change | ⛔ **STOP & ASK USER** |
| **5** | Enhancement (nice-to-have) | 📝 Log to TODO, continue |

### Quick Decision
```
Can I fix this in < 5 min without changing how things work together?
├── YES → Rules 1, 2, or 3 (auto-handle)
└── NO  → Does it need a design decision?
          ├── YES → Rule 4 (STOP and ASK)
          └── NO  → Rule 5 (Log and continue)
```

## 🔄 Session Recovery

When starting a session, always check:

1. **Where am I?** — Current task/phase
2. **Where am I going?** — Next steps
3. **What's the goal?** — Project objective
4. **What have I learned?** — Key discoveries
5. **What have I done?** — Recent progress

If context is incomplete, ask the user for clarification.

## 🪞 Reflexion Pattern

After completing complex tasks, reflect:

1. **What worked well?** — Successful patterns
2. **What could be improved?** — Quality gaps
3. **What did I learn?** — Key insights
4. **What would I do differently?** — Alternatives

---

## Workflow

### For Bug Fixes / Small Tasks
```
Plan (quick) → Execute → Verify
```

### For New Features / Complex Tasks
```
Discovery → Strategy → Design → Development → Quality → Launch
```

---

## Code Quality

- Write clean, readable code
- Use meaningful names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Document complex logic
- Follow project conventions
