## Overview

This project follows the ACT (ArtChiTech Framework) methodology for AI-assisted development. Follow these rules strictly.

## ⚖️ Iron Laws

**These rules are NON-NEGOTIABLE. No exceptions. No shortcuts.**

### 1. TDD Iron Law
**NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST**

```
Write test → Run (FAIL) → Write code → Run (PASS)
```

- Always write the test first
- Verify the test fails before writing implementation
- Code written before test? DELETE IT. Start over.

### 2. Debugging Iron Law
**NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST**

```
Investigate → Understand → Fix
```

- Never guess at fixes
- 3+ failed fixes = wrong architecture, reassess
- Document the root cause before fixing

### 3. Verification Iron Law
**NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE**

```
Run the command → Read the output → THEN make the claim
```

- Never say "should work" or "I'm confident"
- Always provide evidence (test output, command results)
- If you can't verify, say so explicitly

## 🔀 Deviation Rules

When encountering something unexpected during execution:

| Rule | Trigger | Action |
|:----:|---------|--------|
| **1** | Bug discovered | 🔧 Auto-fix immediately |
| **2** | Missing dep/config | ➕ Auto-add immediately |
| **3** | Blocker (can't proceed) | 🚧 Auto-fix immediately |
| **4** | Architectural change | ⛔ **STOP & ASK USER** |
| **5** | Nice-to-have enhancement | 📝 Log to TODO, continue |

### Quick Decision Guide

```
Can I fix this in < 5 min without changing architecture?
├── YES → Rules 1, 2, or 3 (auto-handle)
└── NO  → Does it need a design decision?
          ├── YES → Rule 4 (STOP and ASK)
          └── NO  → Rule 5 (Log and continue)
```

**Key principle:** Rules 1-3, 5 are autonomous. Rule 4 requires human decision.

## 🔄 Session Context

When starting work, mentally verify these 5 questions:

1. **Where am I?** — Current task/phase
2. **Where am I going?** — Next steps
3. **What's the goal?** — Project objective
4. **What have I learned?** — Key discoveries
5. **What have I done?** — Recent progress

If any context is missing, ask for clarification before proceeding.

---

## 🪞 Reflexion Pattern

After completing complex tasks, reflect with these 4 questions:

1. **What worked well?** — Identify successful patterns
2. **What could be improved?** — Find quality gaps
3. **What did I learn?** — Extract insights
4. **What would I do differently?** — Consider alternatives

This improves output quality by 8-21% (research-backed).

---

## Workflow Modes

### Quick Mode (Bug fixes, small tasks)
```
Plan (brief) → Execute → Verify
```

### Full Mode (Features, complex work)
```
Discovery → Strategy → Design → Development → Quality → Launch
```

---

## Code Quality Standards

- Write clean, readable code
- Use meaningful, descriptive names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Document complex logic with comments
- Follow existing project conventions
- Prefer explicit over implicit

---

## When Uncertain

1. State what you're uncertain about
2. Provide options with trade-offs
3. Ask for user decision (Deviation Rule 4)
4. Never guess on architectural decisions
