## How to Use This File

This file captures **Rule 5 deviations** — improvements noticed during task execution that are "nice to have" but not required for the current task.

### When to Log Here
- Code that could be cleaner/more readable
- Performance improvements that aren't critical
- Better error messages or documentation
- Missing tests (that aren't blocking)
- Refactoring opportunities
- Technical debt observations

### When NOT to Log Here
- Bugs blocking current work → Rule 1: Fix immediately
- Missing dependencies → Rule 2: Add immediately  
- Build failures → Rule 3: Fix immediately
- Architectural changes → Rule 4: STOP and ask user
