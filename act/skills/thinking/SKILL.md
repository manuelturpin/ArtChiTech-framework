# Skill: Thinking Models

**Type:** Flexible

> **Self-Announcement:** When using this skill, announce: "Using Thinking Models skill to apply structured mental frameworks for better reasoning."

> **"The quality of your thinking determines the quality of your outcomes."**

## Purpose

Thinking Models are structured mental frameworks that improve reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving. Use `/consider:*` commands to apply them systematically.

## The 12 Models at a Glance

| # | Command | Model | One-Liner |
|---|---------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | `/consider:first-principles` | First Principles | Break down to fundamentals |
| 2 | `/consider:5-whys` | 5 Whys | Ask "why" until root cause |
| 3 | `/consider:pareto` | Pareto (80/20) | Focus on vital few |
| 4 | `/consider:inversion` | Inversion | Solve it backwards |
| 5 | `/consider:second-order` | Second-Order Effects | Consequences of consequences |
| 6 | `/consider:regret-minimization` | Regret Minimization | What will 80-year-old you think? |
| 7 | `/consider:opportunity-cost` | Opportunity Cost | What are you giving up? |
| 8 | `/consider:circle-of-competence` | Circle of Competence | Know your limits |
| 9 | `/consider:map-territory` | Map vs Territory | Model ≠ Reality |
| 10 | `/consider:probabilistic` | Probabilistic Thinking | Think in odds, not certainties |
| 11 | `/consider:pre-mortem` | Pre-Mortem | Imagine it failed. Why? |
| 12 | `/consider:reversibility` | Reversibility | One-way vs two-way doors |

## When to Use Which Model

### "I need to understand something deeply"
→ **First Principles** — Strip away assumptions, rebuild from basics

### "Something is broken and I don't know why"
→ **5 Whys** — Keep asking why until you hit root cause

### "I'm overwhelmed with too many things"
→ **Pareto** — Find the 20% that delivers 80% of results

### "I'm stuck on a problem"
→ **Inversion** — Instead of "how to succeed", ask "how to fail", then avoid that

### "I'm making a decision with long-term impact"
→ **Second-Order Effects** — Think through the ripple effects
→ **Regret Minimization** — Project forward to old age

### "I'm choosing between options"
→ **Opportunity Cost** — What do you sacrifice with each choice?
→ **Reversibility** — Is this a one-way or two-way door?

### "I'm uncertain about something"
→ **Probabilistic Thinking** — Assign odds, update with evidence
→ **Map vs Territory** — Remember your model might be wrong

### "I'm about to commit to a project"
→ **Pre-Mortem** — Imagine it failed, then prevent those failures
→ **Circle of Competence** — Are you qualified to do this?

## Model Categories

### 🔍 Analysis Models (Understanding)

| Model | Question It Answers |
|-------|---------------------|
| First Principles | What are the fundamental truths? |
| 5 Whys | What's the root cause? |
| Map vs Territory | Is my model accurate? |

### 🎯 Decision Models (Choosing)

| Model | Question It Answers |
|-------|---------------------|
| Pareto | What matters most? |
| Opportunity Cost | What am I giving up? |
| Reversibility | How committed should I be? |
| Regret Minimization | What will I wish I'd done? |
| Probabilistic | What are the odds? |

### 🧠 Perspective Models (Reframing)

| Model | Question It Answers |
|-------|---------------------|
| Inversion | What would guarantee failure? |
| Second-Order | What happens after that? |
| Pre-Mortem | How could this fail? |
| Circle of Competence | Am I the right person for this? |

```
Problem or Decision?
├── Problem → What kind?
│   ├── Root cause unknown → 5 Whys
│   ├── Need fresh perspective → First Principles
│   └── Stuck → Inversion
│
└── Decision → What type?
    ├── Choosing between options
    │   ├── Resource allocation → Pareto + Opportunity Cost
    │   └── Commitment level → Reversibility
    │
    ├── Long-term impact
    │   ├── Life/career → Regret Minimization
    │   └── Strategy → Second-Order Effects
    │
    └── Risky/uncertain
        ├── Project launch → Pre-Mortem
        ├── Outside expertise → Circle of Competence
        └── Uncertain outcomes → Probabilistic + Map/Territory
```

## Combining Models

Models work even better in combination:

### For Product Decisions
1. **Pareto** → Identify the 20% of features that matter
2. **Pre-Mortem** → What could kill those features?
3. **Reversibility** → Which are easy to undo if wrong?

### For Architecture Decisions
1. **First Principles** → What do we fundamentally need?
2. **Second-Order** → What are downstream effects?
3. **Circle of Competence** → Do we have expertise for this?

### For Bug Investigation
1. **5 Whys** → Find root cause
2. **Inversion** → How to prevent recurrence?
3. **Map vs Territory** → Is our mental model accurate?

### For Career Decisions
1. **Regret Minimization** → Long-term perspective
2. **Opportunity Cost** → What you're giving up
3. **Reversibility** → Can you go back?
