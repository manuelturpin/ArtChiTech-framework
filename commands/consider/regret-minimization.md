# /consider:regret-minimization

Project yourself to age 80 and ask: "Which choice will I regret less?"

## Usage

```
/consider:regret-minimization [decision]
```

## Description

The Regret Minimization Framework helps make major life decisions by imagining your 80-year-old self looking back. Usually, regret of inaction outweighs regret of action — we regret what we didn't try more than what we tried and failed.

Use when:
- Major life decisions (career, relationships, moves)
- Choosing between safe and adventurous paths
- Decisions involving fear vs. opportunity
- When short-term and long-term interests conflict

## Process

1. **Project to age 80** — Imagine looking back on your life
2. **Evaluate Path A** — "If I chose this, would I regret it?"
3. **Evaluate Path B** — "If I chose this, would I regret it?"
4. **Compare regrets** — Which regret is heavier?
5. **Choose less regret** — Pick the lighter long-term regret

## Example

```
/consider:regret-minimization "Leave stable job to start company"

AT 80, IF I STAYED:
"If the startup would have worked, I'll wonder what could have been.
I'll regret not taking the shot when I was young."
Regret: HEAVY

AT 80, IF I LEFT AND IT FAILED:
"I'll know I tried. I'll have stories and lessons.
The experience itself was valuable."
Regret: LIGHT

ASYMMETRY: Regret of not trying > Regret of trying and failing

DECISION: Take the leap
```

## Key Insight

Studies show people regret things they **didn't** do more than things they did:
- Didn't take the trip
- Didn't tell them how I felt
- Didn't pursue my passion

Failed attempts become stories. "Never tried" becomes sad what-ifs.
