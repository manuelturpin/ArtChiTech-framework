# Second-Order Thinking

> **"First-level thinking says, 'It's a good company; let's buy the stock.' Second-level thinking says, 'It's a good company, but everyone thinks it's a great company, and it's not. So the stock is overrated and overpriced; let's sell.'"** — Howard Marks

## What Is It?

Second-Order Thinking means considering not just the immediate consequences of an action, but the consequences of those consequences. Most people stop at first-order effects; great decision-makers think several levels deep.

## When to Use

- Strategic decisions with long-term impact
- Policy changes (what behaviors will this incentivize?)
- System design (what will users do in response?)
- Negotiations (how will they respond to our move?)
- Any decision where initial effects cascade

## When NOT to Use

- Routine, low-stakes decisions
- When speed matters more than optimization
- When you're overthinking (analysis paralysis)

## Process

### Step 1: Identify First-Order Effects
What are the immediate, obvious consequences?

### Step 2: Ask "And Then What?"
For each first-order effect, what happens next?

### Step 3: Repeat for Third Order
And what happens after that?

### Step 4: Consider Time Horizons
Short-term vs. medium-term vs. long-term effects

### Step 5: Evaluate Full Picture
Decision quality changes when you see all orders

## Example: Pricing Decision

### Action
"Let's cut prices 20% to gain market share"

### Analysis

**First Order:** 
- More customers (yay!)
- Lower margins (boo)

**Second Order:**
- Competitors may match prices → price war
- Customers anchor on low price → hard to raise later
- Attract price-sensitive customers → lower LTV
- Team may cut corners to maintain margins

**Third Order:**
- Price war damages industry profitability
- Brand perception shifts to "cheap"
- Quality talent leaves for higher-margin companies
- Must raise prices eventually → customer backlash

**Conclusion:** Short-term gain, long-term pain. Consider alternatives.

## Example: Performance Metrics

### Action
"Let's measure engineers by lines of code written"

### Analysis

**First Order:**
- More code gets written (yay!)
- Clear metric (easy to track!)

**Second Order:**
- Engineers write verbose code
- Less refactoring (reduces lines)
- Copy-paste instead of abstraction
- Quality suffers

**Third Order:**
- Codebase becomes unmaintainable
- Best engineers leave
- Technical debt compounds
- Product velocity drops

**Conclusion:** Metric creates perverse incentives. Measure outcomes, not outputs.

## Example: Remote Work Policy

### Action
"Everyone must return to office 5 days/week"

### Analysis

**First Order:**
- More in-person collaboration (goal!)
- Better culture (maybe)

**Second Order:**
- Top talent with options leaves
- Recruiting pool shrinks to local only
- Long commutes reduce productive hours
- Office space costs increase

**Third Order:**
- Competitors with flexible policies attract your best people
- Company becomes less competitive
- Cultural backlash (resentment)
- Remaining employees quiet quit

**Conclusion:** First-order benefit may be overwhelmed by second/third-order costs.

## Example: Software Feature

### Action
"Let's add a 'share to social media' button everywhere"

### Analysis

**First Order:**
- More sharing (yay!)
- More visibility

**Second Order:**
- UI becomes cluttered
- Users annoyed by prompts
- Some content shared that shouldn't be (private data)
- Spam concerns

**Third Order:**
- Platform reputation for spam
- Social networks may restrict shares
- Users disable sharing entirely
- Privacy concerns erode trust

**Conclusion:** Selective, contextual sharing beats aggressive everywhere-sharing.

## Template

Use this when applying Second-Order Thinking:

```markdown
## Decision/Action
[What are you considering?]

## First-Order Effects (Immediate)
| Effect | Positive/Negative | Timeframe |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| [Effect 1] | [+/-] | [Now] |
| [Effect 2] | [+/-] | [Now] |

## Second-Order Effects (Then What?)
For each first-order effect, what happens next?

| First-Order | → Second-Order | Net Impact |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| [Effect 1] | [Consequence] | [+/-] |
| [Effect 1] | [Other consequence] | [+/-] |
| [Effect 2] | [Consequence] | [+/-] |

## Third-Order Effects (And Then?)
| Second-Order | → Third-Order | Time Horizon |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| [Effect] | [Consequence] | [Long-term] |

## Summary by Time Horizon
- **Short-term (0-3 months):** [Net assessment]
- **Medium-term (3-12 months):** [Net assessment]
- **Long-term (1+ years):** [Net assessment]

## Decision
[Proceed / Modify / Abandon] because [rationale]
```

## The Chesterton's Fence Principle

Before removing something, understand why it exists.

> "If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away."

This is second-order thinking applied to existing systems. The fence exists for a reason (first-order effect of removal: no fence). What was the original problem it solved (second-order)?

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Analysis paralysis** — You can always go deeper; know when to stop
2. **Overconfidence in predictions** — Nth-order effects are increasingly uncertain
3. **Ignoring first-order** — Sometimes the immediate effect is dominant
4. **Conspiracy thinking** — Not everything has hidden second-order effects
5. **Status quo bias** — Second-order thinking can rationalize inaction
