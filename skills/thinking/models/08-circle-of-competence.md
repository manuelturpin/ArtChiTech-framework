# Circle of Competence

> **"Know your circle of competence, and stick within it. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital."** — Warren Buffett

## What Is It?

The Circle of Competence describes the areas where you have genuine expertise versus those where you don't. Success comes from operating within your circle while honestly acknowledging its edges. Expand it deliberately, but never pretend it's larger than it is.

## When to Use

- Before taking on new challenges
- When making decisions outside your expertise
- Hiring and delegation decisions
- Investment decisions
- Knowing when to ask for help
- Self-assessment and growth planning

## When NOT to Use

- As an excuse to avoid growth
- When the situation demands action despite uncertainty
- When your circle is clearly sufficient

---

## Process

### Step 1: Define Your Circles
Map what you truly know vs. what you think you know.

### Step 2: Be Honest About Boundaries
Where does genuine expertise end?

### Step 3: Identify the Decision Zone
Is this decision inside, on the edge, or outside?

### Step 4: Act Accordingly
- Inside: Proceed with confidence
- Edge: Proceed with caution, seek input
- Outside: Delegate or learn first

### Step 5: Expand Deliberately
Build competence through deliberate practice.

## Example: Technical Decision

### Situation
"Should I architect this distributed system myself?"

### Circle Analysis

**My Circle:**
- Backend development: ✅ Inside
- Database design: ✅ Inside
- Single-server systems: ✅ Inside
- Basic distributed concepts: 🟡 Edge
- Advanced distributed systems: ❌ Outside
- Kubernetes at scale: ❌ Outside

**This Decision:**
Requires advanced distributed systems knowledge.
→ ❌ Outside my circle

**Options:**
1. Pretend I know (dangerous)
2. Hire/consult an expert (wise)
3. Take time to learn first (if schedule allows)
4. Simplify to stay within circle (if possible)

**Decision:** Consult expert for architecture, learn alongside.

## Example: Business Decision

### Situation
"Should I invest in this biotech startup?"

### Circle Analysis

**My Circle:**
- Software: ✅ Inside
- Software business models: ✅ Inside
- General investing: 🟡 Edge
- Biotech science: ❌ Outside
- FDA approval process: ❌ Outside
- Drug commercialization: ❌ Outside

**This Investment:**
Success depends on biotech + regulatory knowledge.
→ ❌ Outside my circle

**The Temptation:**
"The returns look great, and I've done well with software investments."

**The Reality:**
My software expertise gives me no edge here. I'm gambling, not investing.

**Decision:** Pass, or invest only what I can afford to lose completely.

## Example: Delegation

### Situation
"What tasks should I delegate vs. do myself?"

### Circle Analysis

| Task | My Competence | Delegate? |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| Product strategy | ✅ Inside | No |
| Technical architecture | ✅ Inside | No |
| Visual design | ❌ Outside | Yes |
| Legal contracts | ❌ Outside | Yes |
| Sales calls | 🟡 Edge | Maybe |
| Copywriting | 🟡 Edge | Maybe |

**Decision Matrix:**
- Inside + High Value = Do myself
- Inside + Low Value = Consider delegating
- Outside + Critical = Hire expert
- Outside + Not Critical = Skip or delegate

---

## Example: Career Change

### Situation
"Should I transition from engineer to product manager?"

### Circle Analysis

**Current Circle (Engineer):**
- Technical implementation: ✅ Inside
- Code review: ✅ Inside
- System design: ✅ Inside

**PM Requirements:**
- Understanding users: 🟡 Edge (I talk to users sometimes)
- Prioritization: 🟡 Edge (I do this informally)
- Stakeholder management: ❌ Outside
- Business metrics: ❌ Outside
- Market analysis: ❌ Outside

**Gap Analysis:**
~40% overlap, 60% outside current circle.

**Path:**
1. Expand circle first (take PM courses, shadow PMs)
2. Start with technical PM role (more overlap)
3. Build competence before full transition

**Decision:** Expand circle deliberately before jumping.

## Mapping Your Circle

### Three Zones

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           OUTSIDE                   │
│     (Don't know what you           │
│      don't know)                    │
│   ┌───────────────────────┐        │
│   │        EDGE           │        │
│   │   (Know enough to     │        │
│   │    know your limits)  │        │
│   │   ┌───────────────┐   │        │
│   │   │    INSIDE     │   │        │
│   │   │  (True        │   │        │
│   │   │   expertise)  │   │        │
│   │   └───────────────┘   │        │
│   └───────────────────────┘        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Danger Zones

1. **Inside → Edge:** You're competent but reaching limits. Proceed carefully.
2. **Edge → Outside:** You know enough to be dangerous. Get help.
3. **Outside (thinking it's Inside):** Most dangerous. Dunning-Kruger territory.

## Template

Use this when applying Circle of Competence:

```markdown
## Decision/Situation
[What are you facing?]

## Circle Mapping

### Inside (True Expertise)
- [Skill/knowledge area I genuinely have]
- [Another area]
- Evidence: [How do I know I'm expert here?]

### Edge (Know My Limits)
- [Area where I'm decent but not expert]
- [Another area]
- Evidence: [I can do basics but struggle with advanced]

### Outside (Unknown Territory)
- [Area I don't understand]
- [Area I might think I understand but don't]
- Red flags: [Am I overconfident here?]

## This Decision Requires
- [Skill 1]: [Inside/Edge/Outside]
- [Skill 2]: [Inside/Edge/Outside]
- [Skill 3]: [Inside/Edge/Outside]

## Assessment
Overall: [Inside / Edge / Outside]

## Action
- [ ] Proceed with confidence (Inside)
- [ ] Proceed with caution, seek input (Edge)
- [ ] Delegate or learn first (Outside)
```

## Expanding Your Circle

The circle should grow over time, but deliberately:

1. **Adjacent areas** — Expand from where you're strong
2. **Deliberate practice** — Not just exposure, but focused improvement
3. **Feedback** — Get honest assessment of your progress
4. **Humility** — Expanding takes longer than you think

### The 10,000-Hour Reality
True competence takes years. Beware of:
- "I read a book about it" (you're still outside)
- "I did it once" (you're on the edge at best)
- "It seems straightforward" (Dunning-Kruger alert)

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Overestimating your circle** — Most common mistake
2. **Refusing to expand** — Staying forever in comfort zone
3. **Expertise transfer illusion** — Being expert in A doesn't make you expert in related B
4. **Confidence as evidence** — Feeling certain ≠ being right
5. **Underestimating circle** — Impostor syndrome; you may know more than you think
