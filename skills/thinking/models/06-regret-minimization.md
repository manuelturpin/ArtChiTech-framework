# Regret Minimization Framework

> **"I knew that when I was 80, I was not going to regret having tried this. I was not going to regret trying to participate in this thing called the internet that I thought was going to be a really big deal."** — Jeff Bezos

## What Is It?

The Regret Minimization Framework is a mental model for making major life decisions by projecting yourself to old age and asking: "Which choice will I regret less?" It optimizes for long-term satisfaction over short-term comfort.

## When to Use

- Major life decisions (career changes, starting a company)
- Decisions involving fear vs. opportunity
- When choosing between safe and adventurous paths
- When short-term and long-term interests conflict
- Irreversible or hard-to-reverse decisions

## When NOT to Use

- Routine decisions
- When stakes are low
- When the choice is clearly reversible
- For decisions that need analytical, not emotional, evaluation

## Process

### Step 1: Project to Age 80
Imagine yourself at 80 years old, looking back on your life.

### Step 2: Evaluate Path A
"If I chose [Option A], would I regret it?"

### Step 3: Evaluate Path B
"If I chose [Option B], would I regret it?"

### Step 4: Compare Regrets
Which regret is heavier? Usually:
- Regret of **inaction** > Regret of **action**
- Regret of **playing it safe** > Regret of **taking a shot**

### Step 5: Choose Less Regret
Pick the path with lighter long-term regret.

## Example: Career Change

### Decision
"Should I leave my stable job to start a company?"

### Regret Analysis

**If I stay (and the startup would have worked):**
"At 80, I'll wonder what could have been. I'll regret not taking the shot when I was young, healthy, and had less to lose."
Regret: **Heavy**

**If I leave (and it fails):**
"At 80, I'll know I tried. I'll have stories and lessons. The experience itself was valuable."
Regret: **Light**

**If I stay (and it would have failed anyway):**
"At 80, I'll be glad I didn't waste years on something that wouldn't work."
Regret: **None**

**If I leave (and it succeeds):**
"At 80, I'll be glad I took the leap."
Regret: **None**

**Asymmetry:** The regret of not trying (when it could have worked) outweighs the regret of trying (when it fails).

**Decision:** Take the leap.

## Example: Moving Abroad

### Decision
"Should I take this job in another country?"

### Regret Analysis

**If I don't go:**
"At 80, will I wonder what experiences I missed? Will I regret choosing comfort over adventure?"
→ Probably yes. Regret: **Medium-Heavy**

**If I go and hate it:**
"At 80, will I regret trying? I can always come back. I'll have stories."
→ Probably not. Regret: **Light**

**If I go and love it:**
"Life-changing experience."
→ No regret.

**Decision:** Go.

## Example: Relationship Decision

### Decision
"Should I end this comfortable but unfulfilling relationship?"

### Regret Analysis

**If I stay:**
"At 80, will I regret settling? Will I wonder about the love I never found?"
→ Possibly. Regret: **Medium-Heavy**

**If I leave and find someone better:**
"No regret."

**If I leave and don't find anyone:**
"At 80, will I regret leaving stability for loneliness?"
→ Maybe, but: "Will I regret taking the chance to find real happiness?"
→ Probably not. Regret: **Medium**

**Nuance:** This is trickier. The regret isn't as asymmetric. Consider:
- Can you improve the current relationship?
- What's your tolerance for being alone?
- Is "comfortable but unfulfilling" good enough for you?

## Example: Learning a Skill

### Decision
"Should I spend a year learning to play piano?"

### Regret Analysis

**If I don't:**
"At 80, will I regret never learning music?"
→ Probably. Regret: **Medium**

**If I do and quit:**
"At 80, will I regret spending a year on piano?"
→ Unlikely. Learned something, had the experience. Regret: **Light**

**If I do and love it:**
"At 80, lifelong source of joy."
→ No regret.

**Decision:** Learn piano.

## Template

Use this when applying Regret Minimization:

```markdown
## Decision
[What major decision are you facing?]

## Option A: [Safe/Status Quo]
At 80, looking back:
- If it was the right choice: [How would I feel?]
- If it was the wrong choice: [What would I regret?]

## Option B: [Risky/Change]
At 80, looking back:
- If it was the right choice: [How would I feel?]
- If it was the wrong choice: [What would I regret?]

## Regret Comparison
| Scenario | Regret Level |
|----------|--------------|
| Chose A, was right | [None/Light/Medium/Heavy] |
| Chose A, was wrong | [None/Light/Medium/Heavy] |
| Chose B, was right | [None/Light/Medium/Heavy] |
| Chose B, was wrong | [None/Light/Medium/Heavy] |

## Asymmetry Check
Which wrong choice creates heavier regret?
- [ ] Being wrong about A (should have chosen B)
- [ ] Being wrong about B (should have chosen A)

## Decision
Choose [A/B] because the regret of [scenario] outweighs [other scenario].
```

## Key Insights

### Regrets of Inaction Linger
Studies show people regret things they **didn't** do more than things they did.
- Didn't take the trip
- Didn't tell them how I felt
- Didn't pursue my passion

### Failed Attempts Become Stories
"I tried to start a company and it failed" becomes a good story.
"I never tried" becomes a sad what-if.

### Youth is Forgiving
The younger you are, the more you can recover from failed attempts.
Use regret minimization to be bolder while you can.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Romanticizing risk** — Not all risks are worth taking
2. **Ignoring dependencies** — Others (family, team) may bear your regret cost
3. **Survivorship bias** — You hear from people whose risks paid off
4. **Projection failure** — 80-year-old you has different values than current you
5. **Rationalizing** — Easy to justify what you already want to do
