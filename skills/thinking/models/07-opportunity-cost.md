# Opportunity Cost

> **"The cost of a thing is the amount of life which is required to be exchanged for it."** — Henry David Thoreau

## What Is It?

Opportunity Cost is the value of the next best alternative you give up when making a choice. Every decision has a hidden cost: what you could have done instead. Understanding opportunity cost leads to better resource allocation.

## When to Use

- Resource allocation (time, money, attention)
- Project prioritization
- Hiring decisions
- Investment choices
- Any either/or decision
- When something feels "free" (it rarely is)

## When NOT to Use

- When alternatives are truly equivalent
- For trivial decisions (don't overthink)
- When you have unlimited resources (rare)

---

## Process

### Step 1: Identify the Choice
What are you considering doing?

### Step 2: List Alternatives
What else could you do with those same resources?

### Step 3: Value the Best Alternative
What's the value of your next-best option?

### Step 4: Compare
Is your choice worth more than the opportunity cost?

### Step 5: Decide
Only proceed if value > opportunity cost

## Example: Time Investment

### Decision
"Should I attend this 2-hour meeting?"

### Opportunity Cost Analysis

**Resources:** 2 hours of focused time

**Alternatives:**
- Deep work on Project X (high-value, deadline soon)
- Code review for teammate (unblocking them)
- Learning new skill (long-term value)
- Rest (if depleted, this has real value)

**Best alternative:** Deep work on Project X (deliverable worth $10k in value)

**Meeting value:** Unclear agenda, probably $500 in value

**Opportunity cost:** $10,000 - $500 = $9,500 lost

**Decision:** Skip meeting, read summary later.

## Example: Hiring

### Decision
"Should we hire a generalist or a specialist?"

### Opportunity Cost Analysis

**Generalist:**
- Can do many things adequately
- Flexible, can shift between tasks
- Cost: $100k/year

**Specialist:**
- Excels at one critical thing
- 3x productivity in specialty
- Cost: $120k/year

**If we hire generalist, opportunity cost:**
- Lose 3x productivity on critical path
- Critical project delayed by 3 months
- Market window potentially missed
- Value lost: ~$500k

**If we hire specialist, opportunity cost:**
- Less flexibility for other tasks
- Need to hire another person for other work
- Value lost: ~$100k

**Decision:** Hire specialist (lower opportunity cost).

## Example: Feature Development

### Decision
"Should we build Feature A or Feature B?"

### Opportunity Cost Analysis

| Factor | Feature A | Feature B |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Build time | 2 weeks | 2 weeks |
| Revenue potential | $50k/month | $30k/month |
| Strategic value | Opens new market | Retains existing |
| Risk | Medium | Low |

**If we build A:** Opportunity cost = B's value ($30k/month, retention)
**If we build B:** Opportunity cost = A's value ($50k/month, new market)

**But consider:**
- Building B might prevent churn worth $100k
- Building A might not pay off for 6 months

**Adjusted analysis:**
- A: $50k × 6 months - delay costs = $200k net
- B: Prevents $100k churn = $100k net

**Decision:** Build A (but consider building B next, or finding way to do both).

## Example: The "Free" Trap

### Situation
"This tool is free, so we should use it!"

### Hidden Opportunity Costs

**Apparent cost:** $0

**Hidden costs:**
- Learning curve: 20 hours × $100/hour = $2,000
- Integration time: 10 hours = $1,000
- Workarounds for missing features: 5 hours/month = $500/month
- Debugging obscure issues: 3 hours/month = $300/month

**Over 1 year:**
- "Free" tool: $3,000 + ($800 × 12) = $12,600
- Paid tool ($50/month): $600 + saved time

**True cost of "free":** $12,000 more than paid option

**Decision:** Pay for the better tool.

## Example: Sunk Cost vs. Opportunity Cost

### Situation
"We've invested $500k in this project. We can't stop now!"

### Analysis

**Sunk cost:** $500k (already spent, can't recover)
**Future investment needed:** $500k more
**Expected return if completed:** $800k
**Alternative use of $500k:** Project Y with $900k return

**Bad thinking (sunk cost fallacy):**
"We must continue because we've invested $500k"

**Good thinking (opportunity cost):**
- Continue: $500k more → $800k return = $300k gain
- Switch to Y: $500k → $900k return = $400k gain
- Opportunity cost of continuing = $100k

**Decision:** Cut losses, pursue Project Y.

## Template

Use this when applying Opportunity Cost:

```markdown
## Decision
[What are you considering doing?]

## Resources Required
- Time: [X hours/days]
- Money: [$ amount]
- Attention: [mental bandwidth]
- Other: [any other scarce resource]

## Alternative Uses of These Resources
| Alternative | Expected Value | Probability | EV |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|-----|
| [Alt 1] | [$X] | [%] | [$] |
| [Alt 2] | [$X] | [%] | [$] |
| [Alt 3] | [$X] | [%] | [$] |

## Best Alternative (Opportunity Cost)
[Alternative with highest EV]
Value: [$X]

## Proposed Choice Value
Expected value: [$X]

## Comparison
- Proposed choice value: [$X]
- Opportunity cost: [$Y]
- Net value: [$X - $Y]

## Decision
[Proceed/Don't proceed] because [value > opportunity cost / opportunity cost > value]
```

## The Hidden Costs Checklist

When evaluating opportunity cost, check for hidden costs:

- [ ] **Time** — Yours and others'
- [ ] **Attention** — Mental bandwidth is finite
- [ ] **Energy** — Physical and emotional
- [ ] **Reputation** — What you're known for
- [ ] **Options** — Doors that close
- [ ] **Relationships** — Time not spent with people
- [ ] **Learning** — Skills not developed
- [ ] **Health** — Stress, sleep, exercise trade-offs

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Ignoring non-monetary costs** — Time and attention have value
2. **Sunk cost confusion** — Past spending is irrelevant to future decisions
3. **Not valuing alternatives** — Every choice has a cost
4. **Analysis paralysis** — Opportunity cost of overthinking
5. **"Free" illusion** — Nothing is truly free

- **Reversibility** — Irreversible choices have higher opportunity costs
- **Regret Minimization** — Opportunity cost viewed through time
