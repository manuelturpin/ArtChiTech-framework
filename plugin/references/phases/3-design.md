# Phase 3: Design

**Objective**: Design the technical architecture and UX

**Active skills**: `superpowers:writing-plans`, `superpowers:brainstorming`

## Checklist

- [ ] Technical architecture defined
- [ ] Technology stack chosen
- [ ] Data model designed
- [ ] API design (REST/GraphQL)
- [ ] User flows documented
- [ ] Wireframes/Mockups created
- [ ] Design system initiated
- [ ] Security considerations documented
- [ ] Scalability plan
- [ ] Infrastructure plan (cloud, CI/CD)
- [ ] Technical debt strategy
- [ ] Go/No-Go documented

## Anti-Patterns

⚠️ **Over-engineering**: Architecting for 1M users when you will have 100.

⚠️ **Shiny object syndrome**: Choosing a tech because it's new, not because it fits.

⚠️ **Skipping security**: "We'll add security later".

⚠️ **No design system**: Reinventing components for each screen.

## Recommended Tools

- **Figma**: UI/UX design, Design system
- **Excalidraw**: Architecture diagrams
- **dbdiagram.io**: Data modeling
- **Swagger**: API documentation

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| User flows | All documented |
| API endpoints | Specified |
| Components | Design system |
| Security | OWASP checklist |

## Transition → Phase 4

Go Conditions:
