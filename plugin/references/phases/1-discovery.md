# Phase 1: Discovery

**Objective**: Validate the problem and define the value proposition

**Active skills**: `superpowers:brainstorming`

## Checklist

- [ ] Problem Statement validated (clear, measurable)
- [ ] Jobs-To-Be-Done documented (3-5 main JTBD)
- [ ] Personas defined (3-5 personas)
- [ ] Value Proposition Canvas completed
- [ ] TAM/SAM/SOM estimated
- [ ] Competitor benchmark (5+ analyzed)
- [ ] Opportunity Solution Tree created
- [ ] Hypotheses prioritized (impact × uncertainty)
- [ ] User interviews (5-10 minimum)
- [ ] Sean Ellis Test planned
- [ ] Go/No-Go documented
- [ ] Pivot or persevere decided

## Anti-Patterns

⚠️ **Building before validation**: Do not code before validating the problem with real users.

⚠️ **Solution-first thinking**: Starting from "I want to build X" instead of "what problem am I solving?".

⚠️ **Confirmation bias**: Looking for evidence that confirms your hypotheses instead of testing them.

⚠️ **Skipping user research**: Assuming you know the needs without talking to users.

## Recommended Tools

- **Miro/FigJam**: Value Proposition Canvas, Opportunity Solution Tree
- **Notion**: JTBD documentation, Personas
- **Typeform/Tally**: User surveys
- **Calendly**: Interview scheduling

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| User interviews | 5-10 |
| Sean Ellis Test | > 40% "very disappointed" |
| Problem-Solution Fit | Validated |

## Transition → Phase 2

Go Conditions:
- Problem Statement validated by users
- JTBD clearly defined
- Differentiating Value Proposition identified
