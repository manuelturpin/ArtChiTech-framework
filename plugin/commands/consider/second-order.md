# /consider:second-order

Think through the consequences of consequences — what happens after the immediate effects?

## Usage

```
/consider:second-order [action or decision]
```

## Description

Second-Order Thinking looks beyond immediate effects to what happens next. Most people stop at first-order effects; thinking several levels deep reveals hidden costs and benefits that change the calculus.

Use when:
- Strategic decisions with long-term impact
- Policy changes (what behaviors will this incentivize?)
- System design (what will users do in response?)
- Any decision where initial effects cascade

## Process

1. **Identify first-order effects** — Immediate, obvious consequences
2. **Ask "And then what?"** — For each effect, what happens next?
3. **Repeat for third order** — And what happens after that?
4. **Consider time horizons** — Short vs. medium vs. long term
5. **Evaluate full picture** — Decision quality changes when you see all orders

## Example

```
/consider:second-order "Cut prices 20% to gain market share"

FIRST ORDER:
- More customers (yay!)
- Lower margins (boo)

SECOND ORDER:
- Competitors may match → price war
- Customers anchor on low price → hard to raise later
- Attract price-sensitive customers → lower LTV

THIRD ORDER:
- Price war damages industry profitability
- Brand perception shifts to "cheap"
- Quality talent leaves for higher-margin companies

CONCLUSION: Short-term gain, long-term pain. Consider alternatives.
```

## The Chesterton's Fence Rule

Before removing something, understand why it exists. The fence was built for a reason (second-order thinking about its removal).
