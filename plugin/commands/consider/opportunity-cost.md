# /consider:opportunity-cost

Evaluate what you're giving up by making this choice — the value of your next best alternative.

## Usage

```
/consider:opportunity-cost [decision]
```

## Description

Opportunity Cost is the value of what you sacrifice when making a choice. Every decision has a hidden cost: what you could have done instead with those same resources (time, money, attention).

Use when:
- Resource allocation decisions
- Project prioritization
- Evaluating "free" options (nothing is truly free)
- Any either/or decision

## Process

1. **Identify the choice** — What are you considering?
2. **List alternatives** — What else could you do with those resources?
3. **Value best alternative** — What's the value of your next-best option?
4. **Compare** — Is your choice worth more than the opportunity cost?
5. **Decide** — Only proceed if value > opportunity cost

## Example

```
/consider:opportunity-cost "Attend this 2-hour meeting"

RESOURCES: 2 hours of focused time

ALTERNATIVES:
- Deep work on Project X (deadline soon) → $10k value
- Code review (unblocks teammate) → $2k value
- Learning new skill → $500 value

BEST ALTERNATIVE: Deep work on Project X

MEETING VALUE: Unclear agenda, ~$500

OPPORTUNITY COST: $10,000 - $500 = $9,500 lost

DECISION: Skip meeting, read summary later
```

## The "Free" Trap

```
"FREE" TOOL ANALYSIS:
- Learning curve: 20h × $100/h = $2,000
- Integration: 10h = $1,000
- Workarounds: 5h/month = $500/month

1-YEAR COST OF "FREE": $12,600
PAID ALTERNATIVE ($50/month): $600 + saved time

"Free" costs $12,000 more than paid.
