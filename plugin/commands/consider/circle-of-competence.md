# /consider:circle-of-competence

Assess whether this decision falls within your genuine expertise or outside it.

## Usage

```
/consider:circle-of-competence [decision or task]
```

## Description

The Circle of Competence distinguishes areas where you have genuine expertise from those where you don't. Success comes from operating within your circle while honestly acknowledging its edges. Knowing your limits is more important than the size of your circle.

Use when:
- Taking on new challenges
- Making decisions outside your expertise
- Hiring and delegation decisions
- Knowing when to ask for help

## Process

1. **Define your circles** — Map what you truly know vs. think you know
2. **Be honest about boundaries** — Where does expertise end?
3. **Identify the decision zone** — Inside, edge, or outside?
4. **Act accordingly:**
   - Inside → Proceed with confidence
   - Edge → Proceed with caution, seek input
   - Outside → Delegate or learn first

## Example

```
/consider:circle-of-competence "Architect this distributed system"

MY CIRCLE:
✅ Inside: Backend dev, database design, single-server systems
🟡 Edge: Basic distributed concepts
❌ Outside: Advanced distributed systems, Kubernetes at scale

THIS DECISION:
Requires advanced distributed systems knowledge
→ ❌ OUTSIDE my circle

OPTIONS:
1. Pretend I know (dangerous)
2. Hire/consult expert (wise)
3. Take time to learn first (if schedule allows)
4. Simplify to stay within circle (if possible)

DECISION: Consult expert for architecture, learn alongside
```

## The Three Zones

```
INSIDE: True expertise, proceed confidently
EDGE: Know enough to know my limits, proceed carefully
OUTSIDE: Don't know what I don't know, get help
```

## Danger

Outside + Thinking it's Inside = Dunning-Kruger territory (most dangerous)
